You are tasked with creating an API route that soft-deletes conversations from database and optionally removes from ElevenLabs history. This route allows users to manage their conversation history by removing unwanted sessions while preserving data integrity through soft deletion.

Requirements
1. Handle DELETE requests for specific conversation
2. Authenticate user and verify conversation ownership
3. Implement soft delete by setting deletedAt timestamp
4. Optionally remove conversation from ElevenLabs history
5. Preserve related messages for audit purposes
6. Return success response with deletion confirmation
7. Handle errors with appropriate status codes

Dependencies
<prisma_client>
  <include>src/prisma_client_example.ts</include>
</prisma_client>

<types>
  <include>src/types_example.ts</include>
</types>

<auth_config>
  <include>src/auth_config_example.ts</include>
</auth_config>

Instructions
- Export async function DELETE(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string }})
- Extract conversation ID from params.id
- Check authentication with await auth()
- Return 401 if not authenticated
- Fetch conversation: await prisma.conversation.findUnique({ where: { id }})
- Verify conversation.userId matches authenticated user
- Return 403 if unauthorized access attempt
- Return 404 if conversation not found or already deleted
- Soft delete conversation:
  await prisma.conversation.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { deletedAt: new Date() }
  })
- Do NOT delete related messages (preserve for data integrity)
- Optionally call ElevenLabs API to remove from their history (if applicable)
- Return JSON: { success: true }
- Handle errors with try-catch, return 500 for server errors
- Log deletion for audit trail

Endpoint specification:
- Method: DELETE
- Path: /api/conversations/[id]
- Auth: Required (NextAuth session)
- Path params: id (conversation UUID)
- Response: { success: boolean }
- Error responses: 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 500 (server error)

Soft delete benefits:
- Preserves data for analytics and debugging
- Allows potential data recovery
- Maintains referential integrity
- Supports audit trails
- Can be filtered out in queries with WHERE deletedAt IS NULL

Deliverable
- Production-ready TypeScript route handler at app/api/conversations/[id]/route.ts
- Implements soft delete for conversation management
- Verifies ownership before deletion

Implementation assumptions
- Using Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript
- NextAuth manages authentication
- Prisma handles soft delete with deletedAt field
- Messages remain in database for audit purposes
- Deleted conversations filtered out in list queries
- ElevenLabs history cleanup is optional (may not be supported)
