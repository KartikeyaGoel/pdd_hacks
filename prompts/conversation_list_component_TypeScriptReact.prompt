You are tasked with creating a grid of conversation cards sorted by recency, showing date, duration, topic, summary, and Continue/Delete actions. This component displays users' past learning sessions and enables them to review history and resume conversations.

Requirements
1. Fetch and display conversation history from API
2. Show conversation cards in grid layout (responsive)
3. Display date, duration, topic, and summary for each conversation
4. Provide Continue and Delete action buttons on each card
5. Sort conversations by recency (most recent first)
6. Handle loading and empty states
7. Implement confirmation dialog for delete action

Dependencies
<types>
  <include>src/types_example.ts</include>
</types>

<app_store>
  <include>src/app_store_example.ts</include>
</app_store>

<api_client>
  <include>src/api_client_example.ts</include>
</api_client>

Instructions
- Create 'use client' component
- Use Zustand store: const { conversations, isLoadingHistory, loadConversations } = useAppStore()
- Use useEffect to load conversations on mount: loadConversations()
- Fetch conversations with getConversations() from api-client
- Render grid layout (CSS Grid or TailwindCSS grid classes)
- For each conversation, display:
  - Date/time (formatted, e.g., "Jan 15, 2026 at 3:45 PM")
  - Duration (formatted, e.g., "15 minutes")
  - Topic/title (extracted from summary)
  - Summary (2-3 sentences, truncated if too long)
  - Continue button (primary action)
  - Delete button (secondary/danger action)
- Implement handleContinue:
  - Call continueConversation(id) from api-client
  - Navigate to main conversation page with resumed session
  - Emit continueConversation event
- Implement handleDelete:
  - Show confirmation dialog ("Are you sure you want to delete this conversation?")
  - Call deleteConversation(id) from api-client
  - Remove from UI on success
  - Emit deleteConversation event
- Show loading skeleton while fetching
- Show empty state with message and illustration when no conversations
- Add hover effects on cards (border highlight, shadow)
- Use TailwindCSS for responsive grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)

Component structure:
- Loading state (skeleton cards)
- Empty state (message + icon)
- Conversation grid (cards with actions)
- Confirmation modal (for delete)

Card layout:
- Header: date and duration
- Body: topic and summary
- Footer: action buttons

Deliverable
- Production-ready TypeScript React component at components/ConversationList.tsx
- Grid display of conversation history with actions
- Loading, empty, and error states handled

Implementation assumptions
- Using Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript
- API client fetches conversation list
- Zustand store manages conversation history state
- TailwindCSS for responsive grid and card styling
- Component used on /history page
- Conversations sorted by startedAt descending
